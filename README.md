# AI-Interview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementations for my AI Interviewer project.  It includes: - Emotion Recognition from facial expressions using deep learning. - Sentiment Analysis on GP emotions extracted from audio/text.  Both models are part of an integrated pipeline for automated emotion understanding.
